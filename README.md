This is the model for morecookies and arno99xx's 23-24 science fair.

Dataset we used: <a href="https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018" target="_blank">ISIC2018</a>

To download and unzip the dataset, run ```python downloader.py``` in the bash shell. This will take a while.
After everything has been run, run all cells in ```model_test.ipynb```.

```model_test.ipynb``` contains the code for a segmentation and classification model. They are not combined yet.
