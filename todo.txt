basic features needed to be added:
-create layers for model
-compile/organize datasets
--> test, val, train sets
-train model
-optimize (???)
-(optional, but could add a lot to the project) --> create an app
    - add info on further self-diagnosis outside of the model
    - add info on the condition
    - add menu, history
    - camera feature --> take photo
    - amogus!!!
