basic features needed to be added:
-use xception or inceptionv4 for transfer learning
-create layers for feature column data --> use both image + .csv files for classification
-add image randomization layers
-use sgd & compile
-compile/organize datasets
--> val, train sets --> easy if the datasets are already merged
-train model
-optimize (change around some values)
-(optional, but could add a lot to the project) --> create an app
    - add info on further self-diagnosis outside of the model
    - add info on the condition
    - add menu, history
    - camera feature --> take photo
    - amogus!!!
